          To honor 100 years of the luxury brand’s iconic CHANEL N°5 fragrance,
          Patrice Leguéreau, director of the Fine Jewelry Creation Studio and
          master jeweler, has imagined an exquisite and incomparable collection
          of 123 pieces, the “Collection N°5.” As part of this assemblage, he
          was inspired to create a singular necklace, a work of meticulous
          craftsmanship and beauty that interprets the eternal mystery of the
          legendary perfume.

            In 1921, Gabrielle Chanel charged perfumer Ernest Beaux with
            developing a modern fragrance to showcase the multifaceted nature of
            femininity.

            This boundary-breaking scent — which combined more than 80
            ingredients, including synthetic aldehydes — was a huge departure
            from the one-note floral concoctions popularized by society women of
            the time. And its name? A tribute to Chanel’s favorite number: 5. As
            fate would have it, her favored scent medley was Beaux’s fifth
            sample. And the visionary couturier would extend her luck by
            introducing the avant-garde fragrance, which ultimately became a
            best-seller worldwide, on the fifth day of the fifth month of that
            year. In 1932, Chanel once again shattered the codes of French High
            Jewelry with her one and only collection in platinum and diamonds.
            These “Bijoux de Diamants” introduced new ways of wearing adornments
            and took jewelry into another realm.

            “Gabrielle Chanel approached the universes of fragrances and jewelry
            with the same visionary values, focusing on audacity and the quest
            of excellence. I wanted to rediscover that creative gesture with
            this collection.” <br />

            The classic glass flacon features elegant, clean lines with a
            monochromatic white label and chic black lettering. Leguéreau was
            inspired by the perfume decanter’s beloved design and envisioned a
            magnificent necklace that shared its silhouette. <br /><br />
            To create a visual impact worthy of the fragrance’s culture-defining
            legacy, Leguéreau had the idea for an impeccable, Flawless Type IIa
            55.55-carat center diamond.

          The gem’s weight is a calculated homage to the designer’s lucky number
          and is inspired by the shape of the bottle’s stopper, a design that
          reflects the famous Place Vendôme in Paris — also home to the Ritz,
          where Chanel resided. <br /><br />
          The revolutionary fragrance’s heady and alluring aroma encompasses a
          highly complex blend of aldehydes, including an intricately assembled
          mélange of delicious florals like ylang-ylang, May rose and jasmine.
          They are layered over a warm, woody base of vanilla, vetiver, amber,
          patchouli and sandalwood. To bring these elements to life, the
          distinct bottle-shaped motif of the necklace features tailor-cut
          diamonds of varying proportions. Each stone represents a separate
          floral note of the eau’s unique bouquet. The striking gems are
          complemented by a waterfall of pear-shaped diamonds that evoke the
          liquid effect of perfume drops. <br /><br />
          The most potent asset of the venerable scent is its sillage, the
          floating essence a perfume leaves as its wearer moves across a room.
          And just as CHANEL N°5 leaves an indelible impression that has
          influenced our culture over the past 100 years, this exquisitely
          curated necklace was designed to be a long-standing and grand honor of
          the fragrance’s centennial. The eye-catching gems of the 55.55
          necklace diffuse light like a breezy, ethereal aroma. Its sprays of
          scintillating stones summon thoughts of the fragrance’s dazzling
          olfactory burst. Each jewel was hand-selected to be reminiscent of the
          scent’s complexity, collectively giving the statement piece
          unparalleled radiance.
