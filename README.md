## Things I was not sure of

I was unsure if I was building the navbar, so I did for desktop, then hid it for mobile. Usually I would ask designers.

# Things I wanted to do

I would like to add some animations, but also this would have been a conversation with the designer as well, as to what kind of effect would work considering the client and their brand style.
